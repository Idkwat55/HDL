 ## Level 2 : Programs

The next set of `20` programs are listed below.  You can find `cocotb` testbenches in the `tb` folder, and a `.sv` testbench for `counter.v`. Testbenches are provided for most designs, except for smaller testbenches. Example, `bin2gray.v` does not have testbench as the entire design is of a single line :
>  assign  y  =  a  ^ (a  >>  1);
