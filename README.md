# HDL Practice and Skills Development Repository

  

Here is HDL (Hardware Description Language) practice repository! This collection is an ongoing effort to sharpen my skills in digital design using **Verilog** and **VHDL**. Here, I explore both foundational circuits and more complex digital systems, all organized into dedicated folders.

  

Currently, the repository includes:

  

-  **'Verilog' and 'VHDL' Folders**: These contain a few basic circuits, such as multiplexers, flip-flops, counters, and simple state machines, written in Verilog and VHDL.

-  **'Projects' Folder**: The first project in this section is a `UART` transmitter module. This file lays the groundwork for serial communication, and Iâ€™ll continue adding further protocols and subsystems.

-  **100+ Verilog Programs**: This is a 100 programs challenge that I've taken up on myself. At the moment, level 1 is complete, with testbenches for 90% of programs. Level 2 is complete without testbenches. Level 3 is due on SPI and I2C. Level 4 is incomplete.

  

I will update this repository frequently as I work through new concepts, tools, and larger projects, aiming to expand my proficiency in digital design and hardware simulation. Feedback, suggestions, or collaboration ideas are always welcome!
