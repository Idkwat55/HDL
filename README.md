Welcome to my HDL (Hardware Description Language) practice repository! This collection is an ongoing effort to sharpen my skills in digital design using **Verilog** and **VHDL**. Here, I explore both foundational circuits and more complex digital systems, all organized into dedicated folders.

This repository is structured as follows:

- **Verilog/**: Contains basic circuits written in Verilog, ideal for understanding core concepts.
- **VHDL/**: Similar to the Verilog folder, this section is for VHDL-based basic circuits, focusing on building a strong grasp of the language and syntax.
- **Projects/**: This folder is reserved for advanced projects, combining foundational knowledge with more intricate design challenges. 

Currently, the repository includes:

- **Verilog and VHDL Folders**: These contain a few basic circuits, such as multiplexers, flip-flops, counters, and simple state machines, written in Verilog and VHDL.
- **Projects Folder**: The first project in this section is a `UART` transmitter module. This file lays the groundwork for serial communication, and Iâ€™ll continue adding further protocols and subsystems. 

I will update this repository frequently as I work through new concepts, tools, and larger projects, aiming to expand my proficiency in digital design and hardware simulation. Feedback, suggestions, or collaboration ideas are always welcome!
